# Envoy takes several hours to build. We use disk cache to allow rebuilds when needed
# to finish much faster, however GitHub actions does not allow the cache created in a PR
# build to be used in the main branch build. To avoid multiple multi-hour builds, we only
# run Windows CI on the main branch.
